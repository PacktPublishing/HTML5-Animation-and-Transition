# HTML5-Animation-and-Transition [Video]
This is the code repository for [HTML5 Animation and Transition [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/html5-animation-and-transition-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
From modern websites and data visualizations to video games or hybrid applications, animations and transitions are nowadays something that everyone—your clients, users, or managers—will expect your application to have. Thankfully, the latest HTML specification, HTML5, includes many tools to aid you in that mission. In this video series, you'll learn how to get the most out of all of them.

In "HTML5 Animation and Transition", you'll be learning how to develop rich, complex motion graphics using HTML5 APIs such as DOM, CSS3, Canvas, SVG, and WebGL, as well as the basic mathematical concepts behind complex animations—essential knowledge for any modern web developer.

In the "HTML5 Animation and Transition" video course, we will tackle everything that you need to know in order to become an expert at animating elements using the latest HTML5 APIs, starting from the most rudimentary methods such as using the DOM, to the most modern ones such as SVG, CSS3, Canvas, and WebGL. At the same time, you'll also be learning the mathematical concepts required to make complex animations.

Using the first chapters, you will learn (or refresh!) concepts such as vectors, vector operations, interpolations, and easing and acceleration. Then, you'll learn how to display static graphics on the screen using several rendering methods available in HTML5, such as DOM, CSS3, SVG, Canvas, or WebGL. Once you've learned how to display things on the screen, you'll dedicate entire chapters to implement several animation examples using every single rendering method.
